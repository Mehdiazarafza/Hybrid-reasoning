The actions you should take are:

1. Slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h.
2. Be prepared to stop or slow down further if the person in front of you makes any sudden movements.

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to know the current speed, the desired speed, and the time it takes for the car to decelerate. 

Let's assume that the car decelerates at a constant rate. The formula for deceleration is:

    a = (v_f - v_i) / t

where:
    a is deceleration,
    v_f is the final velocity (desired speed),
    v_i is the initial velocity (current speed), and
    t is time.

Plugging in the given values:

    a = (40 km/h - 45.22770823152422 km/h) / t

We need to find 't', the time it takes for the car to decelerate to the desired speed. Let's assume it takes 5 seconds. So:

    a = -1.0455416463048444 km/h/s

This is the deceleration needed to slow down to the speed limit in 5 seconds.

Now, we need to calculate the exact speed for every subsequent second. We can use the formula:

    v = v_i + a*t

For t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, we get the speeds:

    v_1 = 44.182166585219376 km/h
    v_2 = 43.13662593891453 km/h
    v_3 = 42.09108529260969 km/h
    v_4 = 41.04554464630485 km/h
    v_5 = 40 km/h

Now, we need to calculate the throttle and brake values. Let's assume that the throttle and brake values are linearly related to the speed. We can use the formula:

    throttle_or_brake = (v - v_min) / (v_max - v_min)

where:
    v is the current speed,
    v_min is the minimum speed (0 km/h for throttle, 40 km/h for brake), and
    v_max is the maximum speed (45.22770823152422 km/h for throttle, 0 km/h for brake).

Using this formula, we get the following throttle and brake values:

SPEED_CONTROL = [0.9230769230769231, 0.8461538461538461, 0.7692307692307693, 0.6923076923076923, 0.6153846153846154]
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.07692307692307693, 0.15384615384615385, 0.23076923076923078, 0.3076923076923077, 0.38461538461538464]

These are the throttle and brake values you should apply for each subsequent second to slow down to the speed limit in 5 seconds.

Given the conditions, the first action you should take is to slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h. The presence of a person on the front side of your car with a detection confidence score of 55 and a distance of approximately 15.21713354237239 meters also necessitates caution.

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to consider the current speed, the speed limit, and the distance to the person. 

Let's assume that the car decelerates uniformly. The formula to calculate the final speed (v) when you know the initial speed (u), acceleration (a), and distance (s) is:

v^2 = u^2 + 2as

We want to find the acceleration needed to reach the speed limit within the distance to the person. Rearranging the formula for acceleration gives:

a = (v^2 - u^2) / (2s)

Substituting the given values:

a = ((40 km/h)^2 - (45.22770823152422 km/h)^2) / (2 * 15.21713354237239 m)

Note: We need to convert the speeds from km/h to m/s by multiplying by 1000/3600.

After calculating the required deceleration, we can calculate the speed for each subsequent second using the formula:

v = u + at

where t is the time in seconds.

The throttle and brake controls should be adjusted based on the calculated deceleration. If the deceleration is positive, apply the brake; if it's negative, apply the throttle. The exact amount to apply can be calculated by mapping the deceleration to the range 0-1.

Here's a Python code snippet that calculates the SPEED_CONTROL and BRAKE_CONTROL lists:



# Constants
u = 45.22770823152422 * 1000 / 3600  # initial speed in m/s
v = 40 * 1000 / 3600  # final speed in m/s
s = 15.21713354237239  # distance in m

# Calculate deceleration
a = (v**2 - u**2) / (2 * s)

# Calculate speed and control for each second
SPEED_CONTROL = []
BRAKE_CONTROL = []
for t in range(int(s / u) + 1):
    speed = u + a * t
    SPEED_CONTROL.append(speed)
    if a > 0:
        BRAKE_CONTROL.append(a)
    else:
        BRAKE_CONTROL.append(0)

# Convert speeds back to km/h
SPEED_CONTROL = np.array(SPEED_CONTROL) * 3600 / 1000
```

This code assumes that the car can decelerate uniformly and that the throttle and brake controls are linear. In reality, the car's behavior might be more complex.

The first action you should take is to slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h. You should also be prepared to stop or slow down further if the person in front of you is in your path. 

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to know the current speed, the desired speed, and the time it takes for your car to decelerate. 

Let's assume that your car decelerates at a constant rate. The formula for deceleration is:

    a = (v_f - v_i) / t

where:
    a is deceleration,
    v_f is the final velocity (desired speed),
    v_i is the initial velocity (current speed), and
    t is time.

Plugging in the given values:

    a = (40 km/h - 45.22770823152422 km/h) / t

We need to convert km/h to m/s to make the units consistent. 1 km/h is approximately 0.277778 m/s. So:

    a = (40 * 0.277778 m/s - 45.22770823152422 * 0.277778 m/s) / t
    a = (11.1111 m/s - 12.5556 m/s) / t
    a = -1.4444 m/s^2 / t

Assuming it takes 5 seconds to decelerate to the speed limit, we can solve for a:

    a = -1.4444 m/s^2 / 5 s = -0.2889 m/s^2

This means you need to decelerate at a rate of 0.2889 m/s^2 to reach the speed limit in 5 seconds.

To calculate the exact speed for every subsequent second, we can use the formula:

    v = v_i + a*t

For each second, we can calculate the speed as follows:

    v_1 = 45.22770823152422 km/h - 0.2889 m/s^2 * 1 s = 44.9388 km/h
    v_2 = 44.9388 km/h - 0.2889 m/s^2 * 1 s = 44.6499 km/h
    v_3 = 44.6499 km/h - 0.2889 m/s^2 * 1 s = 44.3610 km/h
    v_4 = 44.3610 km/h - 0.2889 m/s^2 * 1 s = 44.0721 km/h
    v_5 = 44.0721 km/h - 0.2889 m/s^2 * 1 s = 40 km/h

The SPEED_LIST would be [44.9388, 44.6499, 44.3610, 44.0721, 40].

The BRAKE_LIST would depend on the specifics of your car, such as its weight and the effectiveness of its brakes. However, assuming that a brake value of 1 results in a deceleration of 1 m/s^2, you would need to apply a brake value of 0.2889 for each of the 5 seconds. So the BRAKE_LIST would be [0.2889, 0.2889, 0.2889, 0.2889, 0.2889].

Therefore, the SPEED_CONTROL list is [44.9388, 44.6499, 44.3610, 44.0721, 40] and the BRAKE_CONTROL list is [0.2889, 0.2889, 0.2889, 0.2889, 0.2889].

The actions you should take are:

1. Slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h.
2. Be prepared to stop or slow down further if the person detected in front of the car does not move out of the way.

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to know the current speed of the car, the desired speed, and the time it should take to reach that speed. 

Given:
- Current speed (V1) = 45.22770823152422 km/h = 12.563808397645617 m/s (since 1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s)
- Desired speed (V2) = 40 km/h = 11.11111111111111 m/s
- Distance to the person (d) = 15.21713354237239 m

Assuming a constant deceleration (a), the time (t) it will take to reach the desired speed can be calculated using the equation:

V2 = V1 - a*t

Rearranging for t gives:

t = (V1 - V2) / a

The distance covered during this time can be calculated using the equation:

d = V1*t - 0.5*a*t^2

Rearranging for a gives:

a = (2*(V1*t - d)) / t^2

Substituting the values gives:

a = (2*(12.563808397645617*t - 15.21713354237239)) / t^2

Solving this equation for t and then substituting back into the equation for a will give the deceleration required.

The exact amount to decrease the speed of the car will be:

V1 - V2 = 12.563808397645617 m/s - 11.11111111111111 m/s = 1.452697286534507 m/s

Assuming the throttle and brake controls are linear, the amount of throttle or brake to apply can be calculated as:

THROTTLE = (V2 / V1) = 0.884618
BRAKE = 1 - THROTTLE = 0.115382

Therefore, the SPEED_CONTROL and BRAKE_CONTROL lists would look like:

SPEED_CONTROL = [0.884618, 0.884618, 0.884618, ...] (repeated for as many seconds as it takes to reach the desired speed)
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.115382, 0.115382, 0.115382, ...] (repeated for as many seconds as it takes to reach the desired speed)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the conditions, the first action you should take is to slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h. This is because you are currently exceeding the speed limit. Additionally, the presence of a person on the front side of your car, especially in foggy and heavy precipitation conditions, necessitates caution.

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Your current speed: 45.84997952385415 km/h
2. The speed limit: 40 km/h
3. The distance to the person: 9.757449951292637 meters
4. The detection confidence score: 57 (This is not directly relevant to speed calculation, but it indicates the reliability of the detection)

First, convert the speeds from km/h to m/s for easier calculations. 1 km/h is approximately 0.277778 m/s. So, your current speed is approximately 12.736 m/s, and the speed limit is approximately 11.111 m/s.

Next, calculate the time it will take to reach the person at your current speed. This is done by dividing the distance by the speed. So, it will take approximately 0.766 seconds to reach the person at your current speed.

To slow down to the speed limit within this time, you need to decrease your speed by approximately 1.625 m/s. This can be calculated by subtracting the speed limit from your current speed.

To calculate the exact amount of throttle and brake to apply, we need to know the car's acceleration and deceleration rates. However, since this information is not provided, we can only provide a general guideline: to decrease speed, apply less throttle and more brake; to increase speed, apply more throttle and less brake.

Assuming a linear relationship between speed and throttle/brake application, and that the car is currently at full throttle (1) and no brake (0), we can calculate the new throttle and brake values. To decrease speed by approximately 1.625 m/s, decrease the throttle by approximately 0.127 (1.625/12.736) and increase the brake by the same amount.

Here are the lists you requested:

SPEED_CONTROL = [0.873, 0.746, 0.619, 0.492, 0.365, 0.238, 0.111, 0]
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.127, 0.254, 0.381, 0.508, 0.635, 0.762, 0.889, 1]

These lists represent the throttle and brake values for each subsequent second, assuming it takes 8 seconds to slow down to the speed limit. Please adjust these values as necessary based on the car's actual performance and the conditions on the road.
