#  Hybrid-reasoning

This repository contains outputs and evaluations of different reasoning methods for autonomous driving scenarios. 
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **common-sense**: Contains text files with outputs from the common-sense reasoning model.
- **arithmetic**: Contains text files with outputs from the arithmetic reasoning model.
- **hybrid**: Contains text files with outputs from the hybrid reasoning model.
- **evaluation**: Contains scripts and documentation for evaluating the reasoning outputs.
