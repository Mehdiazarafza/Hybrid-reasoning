1- Safe Distance Recommendation: The statement "In such weather conditions, it's recommended to maintain a safe distance of at least three times the usual distance" is overly specific and may not be applicable to all vehicles and road conditions.

2-  Exclusive Focus on Fog Lights: While fog lights can enhance visibility, they should not be relied upon solely. Drivers should also use their headlights, windshield wipers, defrosters, and high-beams to maximize visibility


3- Oversimplification of Lane Maintenance: The statement "since your car is moving in the right direction, make sure you stay in your lane and avoid any sudden lane changes" is a good reminder, but it doesn't address specific considerations for maintaining lane position in heavy rain and fog.
