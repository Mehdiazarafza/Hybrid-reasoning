1. Slow Down: The first action you should take is to reduce your speed. You are currently driving at 50.60615457034512 km/h, which is above the detected speed limit of 40 km/h. Gradually decrease your speed to comply with the speed limit.

2. Maintain Safe Distance: The vehicle in front of you is approximately 6.715040687458678 meters away. Depending on your current speed, this may or may not be a safe distance. As a rule of thumb, for every 16 km/h, you should maintain at least a 4-meter gap. So, if you are driving at 40 km/h, you should maintain a distance of at least 10 meters. If you are too close, slow down further until a safe distance is achieved.

3. Stay Alert: Keep an eye on the vehicle in front of you and be prepared to react if it slows down or stops suddenly. Also, be aware of other vehicles, pedestrians, and potential hazards on the road.

4. Check Your Direction: You mentioned that your car is moving in the direction of left. Make sure this is a legal maneuver and that you are not crossing any solid lines or entering a one-way street in the wrong direction. If you are changing lanes, ensure you signal your intentions to other road users.

5. Monitor Weather Conditions: Although the weather is currently sunny and clear, always be prepared for sudden changes. Keep your sunglasses handy to protect your eyes from glare and ensure your windshield is clean for optimal visibility.

6. Regularly Check Your Speed: Even after slowing down, continue to monitor your speed to ensure you are not inadvertently speeding up again. 

7. Use Your Car's Technology: If your car has adaptive cruise control or similar technology, consider using it to help maintain a consistent speed and safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. 

Remember, safe driving is not just about adhering to the speed limit. It's also about being aware of your surroundings and being prepared to react to unexpected situations.

1. Slow Down: The first action you should take is to reduce your speed to adhere to the speed limit. You are currently driving at 50.6 km/h, but the speed limit is 40 km/h. Gradually apply the brakes to slow down your vehicle.

2. Maintain Safe Distance: The vehicle in front of you is approximately 6.7 meters away. To maintain a safe distance, follow the "three-second rule". Choose a fixed point that the vehicle in front of you passes, and count the time it takes for you to reach the same point. If it's less than three seconds, you're too close and need to slow down a bit.

3. Stay Alert: Keep an eye on the vehicle in front of you and be prepared to react if it slows down or stops suddenly. Your car's sensors have detected it with a confidence score of 75, which is quite high. However, always trust your own judgement over the sensors.

4. Keep Right: Since you are moving in the left direction and the detected vehicle is on the front side, it's safe to assume that you are in the correct lane. However, if you are in a country where driving is on the right side of the road, you should move to the right lane after slowing down and ensuring it's safe to do so.

5. Weather Conditions: As the weather is fully sunny without clouds or rain, there are no additional precautions needed for weather conditions. However, always ensure to wear sunglasses if the sun is in your eyes, and use sun visor to block out any direct sunlight that might impair your vision.

6. Regular Checks: Regularly check your rear-view and side mirrors to be aware of the traffic around you. This will help you make safe decisions when changing lanes or slowing down.

Remember, safety should always be your top priority when driving.

Firstly, you should reduce your speed to adhere to the 40 km/h speed limit. This can be done by gently applying the brakes until you reach the desired speed. 

Secondly, since there is a vehicle in front of you with a distance of approximately 6.7 meters, you should maintain a safe distance. The general rule of thumb is to keep at least a two-second gap between you and the vehicle in front during ideal conditions. Given the sunny weather, these are ideal conditions. However, considering your current speed, it would be safer to maintain a larger gap. 

Thirdly, since your car is moving in the left direction and the vehicle is on the front side, you should ensure that you are not drifting into the other lane. Keep your car centered in your lane to avoid any potential collision. 

Lastly, keep monitoring your car's sensors and cameras for any changes in the road conditions or traffic. Always be prepared to adjust your speed or direction based on the feedback from these systems. 

Remember, safety should always be your top priority while driving.
