#  Hybrid-reasoning

This repository contains outputs and evaluations of different reasoning methods for autonomous driving scenarios. 
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Common-sense**: Contains text files with outputs from the common-sense reasoning model.
- **Arithmetic**: Contains text files with outputs from the arithmetic reasoning model.
- **Hybrid**: Contains text files with outputs from the hybrid reasoning model.
- **Evaluation**: Contains scripts and documentation for evaluating the reasoning outputs.

## Directory Structure

- **Common-sense**
  - [rainy.txt](common-sense/rainy.txt): Output for rainy weather conditions.
  - [partly_sunny.txt](common-sense/partly_sunny.txt): Output for partly sunny weather conditions.
  - [sunny.txt](common-sense/sunny.txt): Output for sunny weather conditions.

- **Arithmetic**
  - [rainy.txt](arithmetic/rainy.txt): Output for rainy weather conditions.
  - [partly_sunny.txt](arithmetic/partly_sunny.txt): Output for partly sunny weather conditions.
  - [sunny.txt](Arithmetic/Fully-sunny.txt): Output for sunny weather conditions.

- **Hybrid**
