Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit. The vehicle in front of you is approximately 18.72 meters away, which is a safe distance at your current speed. However, you should always be prepared to brake if the vehicle in front of you slows down or stops.

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to consider the following:

1. Your current speed: 44.307134580384606 km/h
2. The speed limit: 40 km/h
3. The distance to the vehicle in front of you: 18.725628030431178 meters

The speed difference between your current speed and the speed limit is 4.307134580384606 km/h. To convert this to meters per second, we multiply by 1000 and divide by 3600, which gives us approximately 1.196426272884613 m/s.

Assuming you want to reach the speed limit in 5 seconds, you need to decrease your speed by approximately 0.2392852545769226 m/s every second. This is the deceleration required.

Now, let's calculate the throttle and brake values. The throttle and brake values range from 0 to 1, where 0 means no throttle/brake and 1 means full throttle/brake. Assuming a linear relationship between speed and throttle/brake values, we can calculate the required values as follows:

1. Current throttle value: Your current speed is 44.307134580384606 km/h, so the current throttle value is 44.307134580384606 / 100 = 0.44307134580384606.
2. Required throttle value: The speed limit is 40 km/h, so the required throttle value is 40 / 100 = 0.4.

The difference between the current and required throttle values is 0.04307134580384606. Assuming you want to reach the required throttle value in 5 seconds, you need to decrease your throttle by approximately 0.008614269160769212 every second.

Similarly, the brake value required to achieve the required deceleration can be calculated as 0.2392852545769226 / 100 = 0.002392852545769226.

Here are the lists you requested:

1. SPEED_CONTROL: [0.43445707664307684, 0.42584280748230763, 0.4172285383215384, 0.4086142691607692, 0.4]
2. BRAKE_CONTROL: [0, 0.0004785705091538452, 0.0009571410183076904, 0.0014357115274615356, 0.0019142820366153808]

Please note that these calculations are based on a number of assumptions and simplifications. In reality, the relationship between speed and throttle/brake values is not linear and depends on many factors such as the car's weight, engine power, aerodynamics, and road conditions. Therefore, these values should be used as a rough guide and adjusted as necessary based on the actual behavior of the car.

Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit. The speed limit is 40 km/h and you are currently driving at 44.307134580384606 km/h. 

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to know the current speed of your car, the desired speed, and the time it should take to reach that speed. 

Let's assume that you want to reach the speed limit in 5 seconds. 

The formula to calculate the speed for every subsequent second is:

v = u + at

where:
v is the final speed (which is the speed limit, 40 km/h),
u is the initial speed (which is your current speed, 44.307134580384606 km/h),
a is the acceleration (which we need to find), and
t is the time (which is 5 seconds).

First, we need to convert the speeds from km/h to m/s because the standard unit of speed in physics is m/s. 

1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s

So, the initial speed u = 44.307134580384606 km/h * 0.277778 m/s = 12.307134580384606 m/s
And the final speed v = 40 km/h * 0.277778 m/s = 11.111111111111111 m/s

Now, we can find the acceleration a:

a = (v - u) / t
a = (11.111111111111111 m/s - 12.307134580384606 m/s) / 5 s
a = -0.239204693854719 m/s^2

This means you need to decelerate at a rate of 0.239204693854719 m/s^2 to reach the speed limit in 5 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the throttle and brake values. 

Assuming that the maximum deceleration of the car is 1 m/s^2 when the brake is fully applied (brake = 1), and the car doesn't decelerate when the brake is not applied (brake = 0), we can find the brake value as a proportion of the maximum deceleration:

brake = a / max_deceleration
brake = -0.239204693854719 m/s^2 / -1 m/s^2
brake = 0.239204693854719

So, you should apply the brake with a force of 0.239204693854719.

Since you are decelerating, you should not apply the throttle, so throttle = 0.

Now, let's create the SPEED_CONTROL and BRAKE_CONTROL lists. 

SPEED_CONTROL = [12.307134580384606 m/s, 12.067929886529887 m/s, 11.828725192675168 m/s, 11.589520498820449 m/s, 11.35031580496573 m/s, 11.111111111111111 m/s]

BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719]

These lists represent the speed and brake values for each second for the next 5 seconds. 

Please note that these calculations are based on ideal conditions and do not take into account factors such as road conditions, traffic, and car performance.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To comply with the speed limit and avoid a collision with the vehicle in front, you should gradually decrease your speed. Here's how you can calculate the exact speed to maintain for every subsequent second and the corresponding throttle and brake values.

Step 1: Calculate the speed difference
The current speed is 45.65115283446552 km/h and the speed limit is 40 km/h. The difference is 5.65115283446552 km/h.

Step 2: Convert the speed difference to m/s
1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s, so the speed difference is 5.65115283446552 * 0.277778 = 1.569444 m/s.

Step 3: Calculate the time needed to decrease the speed
Assuming a safe deceleration rate of 3 m/sÂ² (which is a typical value for cars), the time needed to decrease the speed is speed difference / deceleration = 1.569444 / 3 = 0.523148 seconds.

Step 4: Calculate the throttle and brake values
Assuming a linear relationship between the throttle/brake values and the speed, the throttle should be decreased by (current speed - speed limit) / current speed = 5.65115283446552 / 45.65115283446552 = 0.1237 (approximately). The brake should be applied with a value of 0.1237 as well.

Here are the lists you requested:

SPEED_CONTROL = [0.8763, 0.7526, 0.6289, 0.5052, 0.3815, 0.2578, 0.1341, 0.0104]
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.1237, 0.2474, 0.3711, 0.4948, 0.6185, 0.7422, 0.8659, 0.9896]

These lists represent the throttle and brake values for each subsequent second. The values decrease linearly from the current throttle value to 0, and increase linearly from 0 to the maximum brake value. This will ensure a smooth and safe deceleration to the speed limit.

Please note that these calculations are based on ideal conditions and assumptions. Real-world driving may require adjustments based on road conditions, traffic, and vehicle behavior.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, you should slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h. Secondly, you should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. The safe distance can be calculated using the 2-second rule, which states that you should ideally stay at least two seconds behind any vehicle that is directly in front of your vehicle.

Let's calculate the safe distance:

The speed of your car is 45.65115283446552 km/h, which is approximately 12.68143023290765 m/s (since 1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s). 

Using the 2-second rule, the safe distance would be 2 * 12.68143023290765 = 25.3628604658153 meters. 

However, the vehicle in front of you is only 16.971448586315276 meters away, which is less than the safe distance. Therefore, you should slow down.

Now, let's calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second and the exact amount you should decrease the speed of the car.

Assuming that the car can decelerate uniformly, the deceleration required can be calculated using the formula:

a = (v_f^2 - v_i^2) / (2 * d)

where:
- a is the deceleration,
- v_f is the final velocity (which should be less than or equal to the speed limit, i.e., 40 km/h or 11.11111111111111 m/s),
- v_i is the initial velocity (i.e., 12.68143023290765 m/s), and
- d is the distance to the vehicle in front (i.e., 16.971448586315276 meters).

Solving the above equation for a gives:

a = (11.11111111111111^2 - 12.68143023290765^2) / (2 * 16.971448586315276) = -0.139 m/s^2

This means that you should decelerate at a rate of 0.139 m/s^2.

Now, let's calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second. The speed at any time t can be calculated using the formula:

v = v_i + a * t

where:
- v is the velocity at time t,
- v_i is the initial velocity, and
- a is the acceleration (which is negative in this case because you are decelerating).

Assuming that you start decelerating at t = 0, the speed at every subsequent second would be:

SPEED_LIST = [v_i + a * t for t in range(0, 10)] # for the next 10 seconds

Now, let's calculate the exact amount of throttle and brake that should be applied at each step. Assuming that the throttle and brake controls are linear and that the maximum speed of the car is 200 km/h (or 55.55555555555556 m/s), the throttle and brake at any time t can be calculated as:

THROTTLE = v / v_max
BRAKE = 1 - THROTTLE

where:
- v is the velocity at time t, and
- v_max is the maximum velocity.

Therefore, the throttle and brake at every subsequent second would be:

The difference between the current and required throttle values is 0.04307134580384606. Assuming you want to reach the required throttle value in 5 seconds, you need to decrease your throttle by approximately 0.008614269160769212 every second.

Similarly, the brake value required to achieve the required deceleration can be calculated as 0.2392852545769226 / 100 = 0.002392852545769226.

Here are the lists you requested:

1. SPEED_CONTROL: [0.43445707664307684, 0.42584280748230763, 0.4172285383215384, 0.4086142691607692, 0.4]
2. BRAKE_CONTROL: [0, 0.0004785705091538452, 0.0009571410183076904, 0.0014357115274615356, 0.0019142820366153808]

Please note that these calculations are based on a number of assumptions and simplifications. In reality, the relationship between speed and throttle/brake values is not linear and depends on many factors such as the car's weight, engine power, aerodynamics, and road conditions. Therefore, these values should be used as a rough guide and adjusted as necessary based on the actual behavior of the car.

Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit. The speed limit is 40 km/h and you are currently driving at 44.307134580384606 km/h. 

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to know the current speed of your car, the desired speed, and the time it should take to reach that speed. 

Let's assume that you want to reach the speed limit in 5 seconds. 

The formula to calculate the speed for every subsequent second is:

v = u + at

where:
v is the final speed (which is the speed limit, 40 km/h),
u is the initial speed (which is your current speed, 44.307134580384606 km/h),
a is the acceleration (which we need to find), and
t is the time (which is 5 seconds).

First, we need to convert the speeds from km/h to m/s because the standard unit of speed in physics is m/s. 

1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s

So, the initial speed u = 44.307134580384606 km/h * 0.277778 m/s = 12.307134580384606 m/s
And the final speed v = 40 km/h * 0.277778 m/s = 11.111111111111111 m/s

Now, we can find the acceleration a:

a = (v - u) / t
a = (11.111111111111111 m/s - 12.307134580384606 m/s) / 5 s
a = -0.239204693854719 m/s^2

This means you need to decelerate at a rate of 0.239204693854719 m/s^2 to reach the speed limit in 5 seconds.

Now, let's calculate the throttle and brake values. 

Assuming that the maximum deceleration of the car is 1 m/s^2 when the brake is fully applied (brake = 1), and the car doesn't decelerate when the brake is not applied (brake = 0), we can find the brake value as a proportion of the maximum deceleration:

brake = a / max_deceleration
brake = -0.239204693854719 m/s^2 / -1 m/s^2
brake = 0.239204693854719

So, you should apply the brake with a force of 0.239204693854719.

Since you are decelerating, you should not apply the throttle, so throttle = 0.

Now, let's create the SPEED_CONTROL and BRAKE_CONTROL lists. 

SPEED_CONTROL = [12.307134580384606 m/s, 12.067929886529887 m/s, 11.828725192675168 m/s, 11.589520498820449 m/s, 11.35031580496573 m/s, 11.111111111111111 m/s]

BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719, 0.239204693854719]

These lists represent the speed and brake values for each second for the next 5 seconds.
