Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit of 40 km/h. Secondly, you should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. The safe distance can be calculated using the 2-second rule, which states that you should ideally stay at least two seconds behind any vehicle that is directly in front of your vehicle.

Let's break down the calculations:

1. Convert the speeds from km/h to m/s: Your current speed is approximately 12.5 m/s (44.98963853543074 km/h) and the speed limit is approximately 11.1 m/s (40 km/h).

2. Calculate the time it will take to reach the speed limit: Assuming a linear deceleration, the time it will take to reach the speed limit can be calculated using the formula t = (v_f - v_i) / a, where v_f is the final velocity (speed limit), v_i is the initial velocity (your current speed), and a is the deceleration. Let's assume a reasonable deceleration of 1 m/s², then t = (11.1 - 12.5) / -1 = 1.4 seconds.

3. Calculate the throttle and brake values: Assuming a linear relationship between the throttle/brake values and the acceleration/deceleration, the throttle should be set to 0 and the brake should be set to a value that will achieve the desired deceleration. If a brake value of 1 corresponds to a deceleration of 10 m/s², then a brake value of 0.1 should correspond to a deceleration of 1 m/s².

Based on these calculations, here are the lists:

SPEED_CONTROL = [0 for _ in range(2)]  # Throttle should be set to 0 for 2 seconds
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.1 for _ in range(2)]  # Brake should be set to 0.1 for 2 seconds

After 2 seconds, you should have reached the speed limit. From then on, you should adjust your speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. If the vehicle in front of you is moving at a constant speed and is more than 2 seconds away, you can maintain the speed limit. If the vehicle in front of you is getting closer, you should decrease your speed. If the vehicle in front of you is getting further away, you can increase your speed up to the speed limit. The exact throttle and brake values will depend on the relative speed and distance of the vehicle in front of you.

Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit. Secondly, you should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. 

Let's calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second. 

1. You are currently driving at 44.98963853543074 km/h, which is approximately 12.5 m/s.
2. The speed limit is 40 km/h, which is approximately 11.1 m/s.
3. The vehicle in front of you is 15.7221828238676 meters away.

Assuming that the vehicle in front of you is moving at the same speed as the speed limit (40 km/h), you should maintain a speed slightly less than 11.1 m/s to avoid collision and comply with the speed limit.

Let's calculate the exact amount you should decrease your speed:

1. Your current speed: 12.5 m/s
2. Desired speed: 11.1 m/s
3. Speed difference: 12.5 - 11.1 = 1.4 m/s

Assuming that you can control your speed linearly, you should decrease your speed by 1.4 m/s over a reasonable time period. Let's say you want to achieve this in 5 seconds. Then, you should decrease your speed by 1.4/5 = 0.28 m/s every second.

Now, let's calculate the throttle and brake control:

1. SPEED_LIST: As you need to decrease your speed, you should reduce the throttle. Assuming that the throttle control is linear, you should reduce it by 0.28/12.5 = 0.0224 every second.
2. BRAKE_LIST: As you need to decrease your speed, you should apply the brake. Assuming that the brake control is linear, you should apply it by 0.28/12.5 = 0.0224 every second.

So, the SPEED_CONTROL and BRAKE_CONTROL lists would look like this:

SPEED_CONTROL = [0.9776, 0.9552, 0.9328, 0.9104, 0.888]
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.0224, 0.0448, 0.0672, 0.0896, 0.112]

Please note that these calculations are based on several assumptions and may not be accurate in real-world driving situations. Always prioritize safety and follow traffic rules.

Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit. The vehicle in front of you is also a factor to consider. You should maintain a safe distance from it. 

Let's calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second. 

Step 1: Calculate the difference in speed. 
You are currently driving at 44.98963853543074 km/h and the speed limit is 40 km/h. So, the difference is 44.98963853543074 - 40 = 4.98963853543074 km/h.

Step 2: Convert the speed difference from km/h to m/s. 
1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s. So, 4.98963853543074 km/h = 4.98963853543074 * 0.277778 = 1.3854166666666667 m/s.

Step 3: Calculate the time needed to decrease the speed. 
Assuming the car can decelerate at a rate of 1 m/s^2 (which is a reasonable assumption for a car), the time needed to decrease the speed is 1.3854166666666667 / 1 = 1.3854166666666667 seconds.

Step 4: Calculate the exact speed for every subsequent second. 
You should decrease your speed by 1 m/s every second. So, the exact speed for every subsequent second is 44.98963853543074 - 1 * t km/h, where t is the time in seconds.

Now, let's calculate how much you should decrease the speed of the car.

Step 5: Calculate the decrease in speed. 
The decrease in speed is 1 m/s every second. So, the decrease in speed is 1 * t m/s, where t is the time in seconds.

Finally, let's calculate the throttle and brake that should be applied at each step.

Step 6: Calculate the throttle and brake. 
Assuming the throttle and brake range from 0 to 1, you should decrease the throttle by 1 * t and increase the brake by 1 * t, where t is the time in seconds.

So, the SPEED_CONTROL list is [0.6145833333333334, 0.328125, 0.041666666666666664] and the BRAKE_CONTROL list is [0.3854166666666667, 0.671875, 0.9583333333333334].

Please note that these calculations are based on the assumption that the car can decelerate at a rate of 1 m/s^2 and that the throttle and brake range from 0 to 1. The actual values may vary depending on the specific characteristics of your car.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, you should slow down your car to comply with the speed limit. Secondly, you should maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you. 

Let's break down the calculations:

1. Your current speed is 44.98963853543074 km/h, which is approximately 12.49712181539798 m/s (since 1 km/h = 0.277778 m/s).
2. The speed limit is 40 km/h, which is approximately 11.11111111111111 m/s.
3. The distance to the vehicle in front of you is 15.7221828238676 meters.

To calculate the speed you should maintain, we need to consider both the speed limit and the distance to the vehicle in front. 

The safe following distance rule is often called the "three-second rule". This rule is designed to give you enough time to react to a sudden traffic situation. 

To calculate the safe speed, we can use the formula: 

Safe speed = Distance / Time

Assuming you want to maintain a three-second distance from the vehicle in front, the safe speed would be:

Safe speed = 15.7221828238676 meters / 3 seconds = 5.240727607955867 m/s

However, this speed is lower than the speed limit. So, you should maintain the higher of the two, which is the speed limit of 11.11111111111111 m/s.

Now, let's calculate how much you should decrease your speed:

Decrease in speed = Current speed - Desired speed
Decrease in speed = 12.49712181539798 m/s - 11.11111111111111 m/s = 1.38501070428687 m/s

To calculate the throttle and brake values, we need to know the maximum speed of your car and its acceleration and deceleration capabilities. However, since we don't have this information, we can't provide the exact values. 

But, in general, you should gradually decrease the throttle and increase the brake to reduce your speed. The exact values would depend on your car's specifications and your comfort level.

SPEED_CONTROL = [0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0]
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]

These lists represent a gradual decrease in throttle and increase in brake over 10 steps. You should adjust these values based on your car's response and your comfort level.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, you should slow down to the speed limit of 40 km/h. The vehicle in front of you is 15.72 meters away, which is a safe distance if you maintain the speed limit. 

To calculate the exact speed you should maintain for every subsequent second, we need to know the current speed of your car in meters per second. 

1 km = 1000 meters
1 hour = 3600 seconds

So, 44.98963853543074 km/h = 44.98963853543074 * 1000 / 3600 = 12.49712181539743 m/s

And the speed limit of 40 km/h = 40 * 1000 / 3600 = 11.11111111111111 m/s

The difference in speed is 12.49712181539743 - 11.11111111111111 = 1.38601070428632 m/s

Assuming that the car can decelerate at a rate of 1 m/s^2 (which is a reasonable assumption for a car), it will take 1.38601070428632 seconds to slow down to the speed limit. 

To calculate the exact amount of throttle and brake that should be applied at each step, we need to know the current throttle and brake settings of your car. Assuming that the throttle is currently at 1 (full throttle) and the brake is at 0 (no brake), you should gradually decrease the throttle and increase the brake over the next 1.38601070428632 seconds to slow down to the speed limit.

Here are the lists:

SPEED_CONTROL = [1, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0]
BRAKE_CONTROL = [0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1]

These lists represent the throttle and brake settings for each tenth of a second over the next 1.38601070428632 seconds. You should adjust the throttle and brake according to these lists to slow down to the speed limit. 

Please note that these calculations are based on a simplified model of car dynamics and do not take into account factors such as air resistance, tire friction, and engine power. For a more accurate control of the car's speed, you should use a car's built-in cruise control system or a professional driving simulator.
