#  Hybrid-reasoning

This repository contains outputs and evaluations of different reasoning methods for autonomous driving scenarios. 
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **Common-sense**: Contains text files with outputs from the common-sense reasoning model.
- **Arithmetic**: Contains text files with outputs from the arithmetic reasoning model.
- **Hybrid**: Contains text files with outputs from the hybrid reasoning model.
- **Evaluation**: Contains scripts and documentation for evaluating the reasoning outputs.

## Directory Structure

  - [rainy.txt](Common-sense/Heavy-rainy.txt): Output for rainy weather conditions.
  - [partly_sunny.txt](Common-sense/Partly-sunny.txt): Output for partly sunny weather conditions.
  - [sunny.txt](Common-sense/Fully-sunny.txt): Output for sunny weather conditions.

- **Arithmetic**
  - [rainy.txt](Arithmetic/Heavy-rainy.txt): Output for rainy weather conditions.
  - [partly_sunny.txt](Arithmetic/Partly-sunny.txt): Output for partly sunny weather conditions.
